## About my current project:
### Github Buddy: ###
#### React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Node.js, Express, PostGreSQL
<ul>
  <li>Github buddy will function as a bug-tracker and developer workflow companion.  This application serves two purposes: first, to be a complex project where I can learn and implement TypeScript and TailwindCSS while refining my React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL skills, and second, to simplify the experience of managing your repos and their corresponding teams.</li>
</ul>

## Other recent projects:
### The Easy Score: ###
#### React, SASS, Node.js, Express, Material-UI, Bootstrap, Redux, Nodemailer,
<ul>
  <li>"A student-oriented web application intended as a course-planning resource. Offers students the ability to quickly and easily compare courses, professors, and grade distributions, as well as to search for which courses satisfy their target requirements (credit hours, time of day, credit types, etc). The site is being redesigned as a single page react app with this repository as our workpoint."</li>
  <li>The application is currently hosted on heroku as a demo, and will be up shortly as we finish tweaking the styling/responsiveness.  Feel free to check it out here: https://the-easy-score.herokuapp.com/</li>
</ul>

### Portfolio ###
#### React.js, Material-UI, Bootstrap, Firebase
<p>Portfolio work-in-progress, utilizing bootstrap, CSS, and material-ui for styling.  Site includes sections for projects and case studies, and offers links to my resume, github, linkedin, and email.</p>
